# Product Guidelines: NeoY's Hacker Podcast

## Tone and Voice

- **Casual & Engaging:** The primary personality of the podcast and interface should be conversational, friendly, and approachable, moving away from a strictly dry or academic tone.
- **Highly Configurable:** Users have the flexibility to define the AI's "System Prompt" or personality, allowing for a personalized listening experience that matches their preference (e.g., humorous, serious, or analytical).

## Visual Identity

- **Modern Dark Mode:** The web interface will prioritize a sleek, high-contrast dark theme that is comfortable for long reading sessions and aligns with the preferences of the developer community.
- **Developer-Friendly Aesthetic:** Clean lines and a focus on essential data, ensuring the interface feels both sophisticated and functional.

## Language and Accessibility

- **Bilingual Support (CN/EN):** The user interface will support both Chinese and English, with an easily accessible toggle to switch between languages.
- **Audio-First Design:** Ensuring that the play controls, progress bars, and episode selection are prominent and intuitive for a seamless audio experience.
